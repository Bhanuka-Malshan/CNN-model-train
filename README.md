# CNN Model Train

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning project for image classification. This repository contains the code and resources to train, evaluate, and save a CNN model for recognizing and classifying images.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a CNN from scratch using Python and popular deep learning libraries to classify images into predefined categories. It focuses on:

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Building a CNN architecture
- Training the model on labeled datasets
- Evaluating model performance (accuracy, loss)
- Saving and loading the trained model

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Modular code for building custom CNN architectures
- Support for common image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or your own dataset)
- Visualization of training progress (loss and accuracy plots)
- Easy to extend with new datasets or architectures
